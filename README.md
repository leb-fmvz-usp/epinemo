  `epinemo` is a package for [R](http://www.r-project.org/), a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. 


`epinemo` stands for **EPI**demiological **NE**twork **MO**dels and is an initiative to guide and automate quantitative analysis in networks.

Current version offers functions that allow users to implement the following workflow:
  
1. Convert an animal movement records database into a network (matrix form).
2. Calculate basic network parameters.
3. Discover network communities.

The current workflow is mainly focused on animal movement records but also applies to other networks. 

To install the unstable version, run `install_github(repo='epinemo', username='leb-fmvz-usp', auth_user='lebvps', password='qwerty12345')` in (ideally) RStudio. `devtools` package must be previously loaded.

If you find any error or have suggestions to improve or include functionality to `epinemo`, we want to know it. Please get in touch so we can better understand your needs.
